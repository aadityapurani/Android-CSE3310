## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
MavsEvent is a caterering management application which is designed to serve as a Hypothetical UTA Catering system. The goal of the project is to create a relationship between Caterer, Staff and User in a way orders are placed and managed easily. This project is a part of Introduction to Software Engineering (CSE3310) offered at The University of Texas at Arlington.

## Process <a name="process"></a>
The development of the final product is based on the series of Iterations. During the first Iteration, we gathered requirements for the application (i.e what functionalities should be available to what user roles). We also modelled a Domain Diagram and Use Case Diagram to visually simulate the functionality. For the second iteration, we focused on what the functionalities should do accurately and thus we designed a Use Case Interaction Diagram / Sequence Diagram and High Level Use Cases. Based on that, we created a User Interface prototype and linked the Intents. For the Third Iteration, we started developing the application as well as modelling Domain Class Diagram. This is where we integrated the prototype UI with Models, Controllers and Database. We also kept UI designing in mind as a good app requires blend of catchy UI as well as robust backend And finally after more than 200 commits we are here !
